## IEEE MRU WEBSITE

Hello there! Hope you're doing well. Here I present my contribution for the IEEE MRU Student Branch Website I worked on during my summer break.

My involvement is in making the design and responsive front-end. I worked on two sections: About and Chapters.

About:
I've seperated the section in a grid of two column and one row. The images on the right use Absolute positioning to overlap and zoom on hover becuase of the translate property upto a scale of 1.5.

For responsiveness, the image side of grid changes order and appears first rather than the content.

Chapters:
I have used flexbox to place the buttons and grid for image and content container.

The funtionality is basic. I've directly changed the text and image by button click event and manually set the conetnt.
