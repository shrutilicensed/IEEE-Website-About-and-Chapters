              IEEE Student branch and its members inspire people to innovate for
              a better tomorrow through its more than
              <strong> 396,000 </strong> members. We look up to enhance the
              learning experience of the student community at the MRU campus.
              The Student Branch focuses on conducting social and technical
              activities for students, and also encourages the students to take
              full advantage of the benefits of
              <em> IEEE membership, including scholarships, competitions, </em>
              and <em> conference grants </em>. We at MRU began with the motto
              of enhancing and engaging our activities with professionals from
              various fields to improvise our abilities under the domain of
              <strong> STEM </strong>. We have one affinity group:
              <strong> WIE </strong> and one chapter:
              <strong> Computer Science Society </strong> running in our MRU
              Student Branch.
